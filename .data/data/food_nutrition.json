Besides being a food additive, turmeric has been used for centuries in Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, and other traditional medicines as a remedy for stomach and liver ailments.Curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric, contains a mixture of powerful phytonutrients known as curcuminoids. Curcuminoids have antioxidant properties, meaning they fight the damaging effects of free radical molecules in the body and may have significant anti-inflammatory effects.Curcuminoids may play a part in blocking a key biological pathway that causes damage to cells and may lead to their unhealthy, unrestrained growth¹. They shut down nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), known to regulate expression of more than 300 genes that promote inflammatory responses which lead to joint inflammation and cell damage.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/vitamin-supplement/4/f/2/curcumin-475mg-vista-nutrition-120-original-imaejwgkmejess3h.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/vitamin-supplement/4/f/2/curcumin-475mg-vista-nutrition-120-original-imaejwgkmejess3h.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/vitamin-supplement/4/f/2/curcumin-475mg-vista-nutrition-120-original-imaejwgkmejess3h.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["VSLEKM37BCEKA4F2"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":2000,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":2000,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":1400,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/vista-nutrition-curcumin-475mg/p/itmekm37zjpendnt?pid=VSLEKM37BCEKA4F2&affid=yuganshch","productBrand":"Vista Nutrition","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":30,"offers":["Extra 5% off* with Axis Bank Buzz Credit Card"],"categoryPath":"Food & Nutrition>Health & Nutrition>Vitamins & Supplements","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"","sellerName":"himmath jain","sellerAverageRating":4.4,"sellerNoOfRatings":674,"sellerNoOfReviews":2},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["Special Supplements","Capsules Form","Suitable For: Vegetarian","Pack of 1"],"detailedSpecs":["Special Supplements","Capsules Form","Suitable For: Vegetarian","Pack of 1"],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Brand","value":["Vista Nutrition"]},{"key":"Model Name","value":["Curcumin - 475mg"]},{"key":"Model Number","value":["Curcumin - 475mg"]},{"key":"Quantity","value":["120 No"]},{"key":"Type","value":["Special Supplements"]},{"key":"Form","value":["Capsules"]},{"key":"Dietary Preference","value":["Gluten Free"]},{"key":"Composition","value":["Turmeric Extract (Curcuma longa) (standardized to 95% curcuminoids)(rhizome) - Curcumin - 950mg"]},{"key":"Number of Scoops per Container","value":["60"]},{"key":"Ayurvedic","value":["No"]},{"key":"Maximum Shelf Life","value":["18 Months"]},{"key":"Container Type","value":["Bottle"]},{"key":"Food Preference","value":["Vegetarian"]},{"key":"Serving Size","value":["2 No"]}]},{"key":"Important Note","values":[{"key":"  ","value":["Product information provided by the seller on the Website is not exhaustive, please read the label on the physical product carefully for complete information provided by the manufacturer.

Eat your Spirulina greens for good health! Supplement your intake of fruits and vegetables with 1 serving of Earthrise Spirulina a day - equivalent to 3-4 servings of common vegetables a day in terms of antioxidant content (B-carotene).A tiny water plant holds the promise of bringing about a sea change in your healthJapanese scientists look towards spirulina as the solution to the world's hunger problem. NASA considers it an excellent, compact space food for astronauts. The WHO has called it one of the greatest super foods on earth. And New Agers all over the world are rediscovering the wonders of spirulina. The single-celled bluish-green water alga is believed to be the first form of plant life on earth and formed a part of man's early diet. But its rising popularity in the last couple of decades can be traced to a French anthropologist who found, earlier this century, that a plankton from Lake Chad in North Africa was behind the remarkably good health of the Kanembi tribe living on the lakeside. He took it back home to study its composition. What was 'dihe' to the Kanembis came to be known as spirulina, the word derived from the algae's spirally twisted filament-like structure.From origin to content: 1 kg of spirulina, it is claimed, is the equivalent of 1,000 kg of assorted vegetables; 10 gm of spirulina contain 6.6 gm of protein (milk has 0.32 gm). In addition, it has no bad cholesterol, has 18 of the 22 amino acids the body needs, and is the richest source of beta-carotene, an antioxidant which combats free radicals.

Found in highest concentration in cell mitochondria (where energy is produced), its primary function is to help with the conversion of food and oxygen into energy. CoQ10 is also a powerful antioxidant and may help neutralize damage-causing free radicals.Although CoQ10 is involved in every bodily process that requires energy, it's believed to be of fundamental importance in cells with high metabolic demands, such as cardiac cells. The heart, with greater energy requirements than other organs, contains twice as much CoQ10 as any other tissue in the body. Studies show that CoQ10 supports healthy blood pressure and cholesterol levels, while also promoting healthy immune-system function.Studies in Parkinson's disease indicate that between 400 mg and 1,200 mg daily is safe and may be effective at slowing progression of this crippling disorder. Optimal benefit was obtained at 1,200 mg per day. Other studies indicated CoQ10 clearly can protect brain cells (neurons) from deadly free radicals.CoQ10 may also help with periodontal diseases, especially gingivitis. Research indicates that the gum tissue of individuals with periodontal disease is significantly deficient in CoQ10.

CoQ10 is also a powerful antioxidant and may help neutralize damage-causing free radicals.Although CoQ10 is involved in every bodily process that requires energy, it's believed to be of fundamental importance in cells with high metabolic demands, such as cardiac cells.

DHA is essential for the proper growth and development of the infant brain, and appears to affect function throughout one's lifetime. Low levels of this important fatty acid may be connected to increased incidence of poor mood, personality and behavior.

Magnesium and vitamin D increase the absorption of calcium.Magnesium is the “anti-stress” mineral that promotes relaxation,supports nerve conduction and helps induce restful sleep. Magnesium alsoassists in the purification of body tissue and enhances energy levels.Vitamin D is necessary for maintaining favorable calcium levels in thebody.

The result? Your cartilage and bones begin to scrape against each other, your joints become damaged, and the lubricating synovial fluid in your joint spaces becomes thin and watery. To ensure effective absorption and tissue utilization, it's highly recommended that one takes glucosamine in the sulfate form. This is the way glucosamine is found in the body.Chondroitin sulfate attracts and holds large amounts of water to the cartilage-building proteoglycan molecules. Since cartilage has no blood supply, this fluid is necessary to nourish and lubricate joints. All supplements are packaged in HDPE (High Density Polyethylene) bottles.

Found in highest concentration in cell mitochondria (where energy is produced), its primary function is to help with the conversion of food and oxygen into energy. CoQ10 is also a powerful antioxidant and may help neutralize damage-causing free radicals.Although CoQ10 is involved in every bodily process that requires energy, it's believed to be of fundamental importance in cells with high metabolic demands, such as cardiac cells. The heart, with greater energy requirements than other organs, contains twice as much CoQ10 as any other tissue in the body. Studies show that CoQ10 supports healthy blood pressure and cholesterol levels, while also promoting healthy immune-system function.Studies in Parkinson's disease indicate that between 400 mg and 1,200 mg daily is safe and may be effective at slowing progression of this crippling disorder. Optimal benefit was obtained at 1,200 mg per day. Other studies indicated CoQ10 clearly can protect brain cells (neurons) from deadly free radicals.CoQ10 may also help with periodontal diseases, especially gingivitis. Research indicates that the gum tissue of individuals with periodontal disease is significantly deficient in CoQ10. Supplementing may provide the increased energy production needed by cells to maintain healthy gum and mouth tissue.Levels of CoQ10 decline with age, which may result in less efficient organ function because of reduced energy supply. Some scientists studying aging believe the decline of energy production within the cell is the main cause of cell death and dysfunction that occurs with aging. Statin drugs, taken for high cholesterol, also deplete the body of CoQ10.Although found naturally in foods such as fish, organ meats and peanuts, supplementing with CoQ10 provides a potent dose of this important nutrient that may be lacking in your diet.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/vitamin-supplement/r/v/n/coq-10-100mg-vista-nutrition-120-original-imaekkzenpnsntu6.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/vitamin-supplement/r/v/n/coq-10-100mg-vista-nutrition-120-original-imaekkzenpnsntu6.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/vitamin-supplement/r/v/n/coq-10-100mg-vista-nutrition-120-original-imaekkzenpnsntu6.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["VSLEKM333HASKZMS","VSLEKM34PD7D8XCH","VSLEKM2XV3TAKRVN"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":3050,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":3050,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":2135,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/vista-nutrition-coq10-100mg/p/itmekm33aytz2zfh?pid=VSLEKM2XV3TAKRVN&affid=yuganshch","productBrand":"Vista Nutrition","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":30,"offers":["Extra 5% off* with Axis Bank Buzz Credit Card"],"categoryPath":"Food & Nutrition>Health & Nutrition>Vitamins & Supplements","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"","sellerName":"himmath jain","sellerAverageRating":4.4,"sellerNoOfRatings":674,"sellerNoOfReviews":2},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["Special Supplements","Capsules Form","Suitable For: Vegetarian","Pack of 1"],"detailedSpecs":["Special Supplements","Capsules Form","Suitable For: Vegetarian","Pack of 1"],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Brand","value":["Vista Nutrition"]},{"key":"Model Name","value":["CoQ10 - 100mg"]},{"key":"Model Number","value":["CoQ - 10 - 100mg"]},{"key":"Quantity","value":["120 No"]},{"key":"Type","value":["Special Supplements"]},{"key":"Form","value":["Capsules"]},{"key":"Dietary Preference","value":["No Cholesterol"]},{"key":"Composition","value":["Co-Enzyme Q10 (ubiauione)- 100mg"]},{"key":"Number of Scoops per Container","value":["120"]},{"key":"Ayurvedic","value":["No"]},{"key":"Maximum Shelf Life","value":["18 Months"]},{"key":"Container Type","value":["Bottle"]},{"key":"Food Preference","value":["Vegetarian"]},{"key":"Serving Size","value":["1 No"]}]},{"key":"Important Note","values":[{"key":"  ","value":["Product information provided by the seller on the Website is not exhaustive, please read the label on the physical product carefully for complete information provided by the manufacturer.

Plants create trans-resveratrol to protect themselves against the effects of poor growing conditions and severe weather. Found in grapes and wine, Resveratol is a naturally occurring antioxidant that contains number of health benefits . Reveratrol is a protective compound produced by red grapes and cetain other plants as defence against parasits. While red wine previously contained 8 to 10mg resveratol per litre, there is unfortunately almost no resveratrol in today’s red wine due to widespread use of pesticides. We have, however, managed to find a source of pharmaceuticals grade resveratrol, extracted directly from red grapes, which retains the natural balance of all its active compounds: polyphenols, flavonoids, anthocyanidins and oligoproanthocyanidins (OPCs). Resveratrol may improve health and longevity by mimicking some of the beneficial effects of a calorie restricted diet, the only intervention known to extend life in mammals.

Now, presenting first time in India, An Ultimate Skin Lightning Solution - Radiplex Light. Approved and prescribed by the leading Dermatologists. Here are the Ingredients of Radiplex Light: 1) L-Glutathione inhibits and blocks Tyrosinase, the enzyme responsible for the production of dark melanin pigments in our skin. Consistent supplementation will result into gradual skin lightening. Research has proven that L-Glutathione lightens dark skin pigmentations as it reverses the melanin's metabolism from dark pigmentations into light pigmentations. 2) Vitamin C effects pigmentation in two ways: The creation of melanin is an oxidative process and so a powerful antioxidant like vitamin C could counteract the oxidative process required to create melanin. Ascorbic acid also has a role to play as an inhibitor Tyrosinase. Tyrosinase is essential for the formation of melanin, so if it is inhibited then the action of pigmentation is reduced. 3) Alpha Lipoic Acid has the remarkable ability to recycle several other important antioxidants including vitamins C and E, glutathione and coenzyme Q10, as well as itself! For these reasons, alpha lipoic acid has been called the universal antioxidant. 4) Grape Seed Extract is a natural plant constituent which strengthens and protects living tissue. The OPC components in Grape Seed Extract are 50 times stronger than Vitamin E and 20 times stronger than Vitamin C. Grape Seed Extract is an antiallergenic, antihistamine, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant. It strengthens blood vessels, improves skin, and aids in circulation. Radiplex Light 500 mg contains 30 capsules per bottle.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/j0sg7m80/vitamin-supplement/c/q/r/30-light-500-mg-capsules-an-ultimate-glutathione-product-for-original-imaesgc5kthjzjxb.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/j0sg7m80/vitamin-supplement/c/q/r/30-light-500-mg-capsules-an-ultimate-glutathione-product-for-original-imaesgc5kthjzjxb.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/j0sg7m80/vitamin-supplement/c/q/r/30-light-500-mg-capsules-an-ultimate-glutathione-product-for-original-imaesgc5kthjzjxb.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["VSLERB6MBEM8XCQR"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":3499,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":3499,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":3489,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/radiplex-light-500mg-capsules-ultimate-glutathione-product-skin-whitening/p/itmerb6mtm3hzfaf?pid=VSLERB6MBEM8XCQR&affid=yuganshch","productBrand":"Radiplex","inStock":true,"codAvailable":true,"discountPercentage":0,"offers":["Extra 5% off* with Axis Bank Buzz Credit Card"],"categoryPath":"Food & Nutrition>Health & Nutrition>Vitamins & Supplements","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":""}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"Usually Delivered in 9 - 10 days.","sellerName":"Ankit Agrawal","sellerAverageRating":null,"sellerNoOfRatings":0,"sellerNoOfReviews":0},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["Anti-Oxidants Supplements","Capsules Form","Suitable For: Vegetarian","Pack of 1"],"detailedSpecs":["Anti-Oxidants Supplements","Capsules Form","Suitable For: Vegetarian","Pack of 1"],"specificationList":[{"key":"In The Box","values":[{"key":"Sales Package","value":["1 Radiplex Light 500 mg - 30 capsules"]}]},{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"Brand","value":["Radiplex"]},{"key":"Model Name","value":["Light 500mg Capsules - An Ultimate Glutathione Product For Skin Whitening"]},{"key":"Model Number","value":["Light 500 mg Capsules - An Ultimate Glutathione Product For Skin Whitening"]},{"key":"Quantity","value":["30 No"]},{"key":"Type","value":["Anti-Oxidants"]},{"key":"Form","value":["Capsules"]},{"key":"Composition","value":["L Glutathione 500mg, Vitamin C 200mg, Alpha Lipoic Acid 100mg, Grape Seed Extract 50mg, Pine Bark Extract 50mg: Vitamin E 50mg, GSH Booster Complex"]},{"key":"Ayurvedic","value":["No"]},{"key":"Maximum Shelf Life","value":["18 Months"]},{"key":"Container Type","value":["Bottle"]},{"key":"Food Preference","value":["Vegetarian"]},{"key":"Serving Size","value":["1 No"]}]},{"key":"Important Note","values":[{"key":"  ","value":["Product information provided by the seller on the Website is not exhaustive, please read the label on the physical product carefully for complete information provided by the manufacturer.

But it could well happen to you with the Bodh Second Flush Black. This exquisite Black is named Bodh, which means Blossoming or Awakening for all the right reasons. After the first flush and a month of dormancy, the second flush arrives. Since the start of spring, the bushes have had time to absorb moisture and other nutrients from the soil and are sufficiently energized to carryon with their business of producing delicious tea leaves. In sharp contrast to the first flush, the leaves are bolder with more sap and tannin. The colour of the final tea has a brownish sheen with golden tips, called ‘bloom’. The liquors range from golden amber to orange in the colour spectrum. The taste is muscatel, mellow and floral. Our teas taste best in their natural form. Light milk and sugar or honey and lime can be added to complement your taste preferences. Best enjoyed at: Early morning or late evening. The sensory experience: The liquor ranges from golden amber to orange in the colour spectrum. The taste is muscatel, mellow and floral. Our Unique Pyramid Tea Bags:Our new generation \"Pyramid Tea Bags“ change all the old rules of tea brewing. It brings a new innovation to tea drinking with an added advantage of convenience. In order to brew properly, tea leaves have to move around. Only tiny tea dust particles could move around in the tiny space of a traditional tea bag which is the primary reason why tea dust was and is used in traditional tea bags. This meant you got a tea with great colour, a strong brew but poor quality. With the new addition of pyramid tea bags to our portfolio we provide an additional advantage to brew our teas with convenience and without compromising on the quality of tea brewed.
