Now, there's no need to visit the theatre as you can watch your favourite flicks come to life right in your living room. 4K HDR If you watch a fantasy film like 'The Hobbit' on this TV, you're sure to be mesmerized by how lifelike the fictional can seem. This BRAVIA TV couples 4K technology with a High Dynamic Range to reproduce images with enhanced colour, brightness and contrast. Slim Backlight Drive While a video plays, Sony's Slim Backlight Drive technology identifies high-contrast areas and dynamically adjusts the backlight. This way, blacks are highlighted and other colours look more vibrant. Triluminos Display Triluminos display technology ensures that subtle colours don't get too saturated so every hue in the colour gamut looks vivid and natural. X-tended Dynamic Range PRO X-tended Dynamic Range PRO is a special backlighting algorithm that makes brights more lucid while adding more depth to blacks. When coupled with an HDR signal, this technology makes images even more brilliant. Android TV: A World of Possibilities You can connect this TV to various Android-based devices, such as smartphone or tablets. All the things you love doing on your smartphone, such as using apps or watching movies, you can do with this TV. 4K X-Reality PRO By analysing and matching individual parts of every scene, 4K X-Reality PRO technology improves contrast, edges, colour and pictorial texture. 4K Processor X1 Whether you're watching a movie from a TV broadcast, DVD, Blue-Ray Disc or a 4K YouTube video, this powerful processor assesses and enhances it to near-4K resolution. A Master Piece of Design It's super-slim design and grand size are sure to make your living room look more luxurious. Thanks to smart cable management, it's wires don't jut out and it melds right onto your wall. Google Play There's a universe of games, movies, TV shows and other apps that are available on Google's Play Store which you can access on this TV.  Now, all the content that you enjoy on your smartphone or tablet, you can enjoy on a larger screen. Google Cast Use Google Cast to mirror content, like YouTube videos, from your Android/iOS-based smartphone or tablet on to this TV's spectacular screen. Voice Search Now, you don't need to type and waste time when you're trying to hunt down a specific movie or show on your TV. Simply use your voice to search for content across various services. Also, if you search for 'romantic comedies', you'll get a list of related results, so you can discover fresh content. Immerse Yourself in 3D Thanks to Sony's 3D technology, you just need to put on a pair of active shutter glasses to enhance the natural depth of field of images. Make your favourite film characters come to life in your living room in 3D. Motionflow XR By comparing crucial visual factors frame-after-frame and inserting additional frames when there are lapses between sequences, Motionflow XR technology ensures clear, blur-free videos. Super-slim Flush Surface Display This TV features a flush finish and doesn't have raised bezels, so you'll barely notice the edges. Clean-rear Look If you've placed this TV on a table, its cables will stay out of sight, thanks to a hidden cable-panel structure. The cables are concealed behind the panel and exit the stand through the centre. X-Protection PRO There aren't any ventilation holes behind this TV, so it's highly unlikely that dust will find its way inside. If there's an electrical surge, a primary capacitor will safeguard this TV. There's an anti-humidity coating on the circuit board, so it won't short circuit even if moisture levels are high in the air. Content Bar While a video you're watching continues to play in the background, you can use the Content Bar to check what's happening on other channels or to browse through downloaded movies. You have the option of customizing the Content Bar to display the content that you watch often. IR Blaster Not only can you use the Infra-red (IR) Blaster remote to control this TV, you can also use it to control other devices such as your set-top box or cable box. Serial AbTak Use Serial AbTak, Sony's exclusive catch-up TV app, to enjoy a variety of TV shows from national and regional channels. You can assign favourites, create custom playlists or organize shows by channel, language or episode too. TV SideView App Use the TV SideView app to search, record and talk about your favourite TV shows. You can also check out the latest TV schedules or popular TV shows on your Android/iOS smartphone or tablet. You can also set an alarm to remind you when you're favourite TV show is on. In addition, you can live-tweet your reactions and read what other viewers have to say about it too. Notify BRAVIA Every time you get a call, message or social-app update on your smartphone, you'll be notified on your TV's screen. All you have to do is download the Notify BRAVIA app from Google Play on your smartphone and ensure that it is connected to the same network as your TV. ClearAudio+ ClearAudio+ technology refines sounds for a more immersive aural experience. It ensures that music, dialogues and OSTs sound clearer with greater separation. Cinematic S-Force Front Surround By emulating the way the human brain processes sounds, S-Force Front Surround technology helps this TV produce volume at ideal levels. Time lag and the sound wave spectrum are optimized for rich, high-fidelity audio too. Digital Sound Enhancement Engine Audio from low-res videos and low-quality MP3 files are heavily compressed, which leads to a lot of loss in quality. Sony's Digital Sound Enhancement Engine restores lost frequencies, especially high frequencies, to make the audio sound more natural. Clear Phase Sony's Clear Phase technology accurately samples frequencies and corrects inconsistencies in the peaks and troughs of sound waves for a richer sound.

Bring home this BRAVIA TV to watch movies in Full HD 3D quality and to have a marvelous cinematic experience in your living room itself. 4K HDR Watch the magic of timeless movies like Harry Potter come to life in your living room with this BRAVIA TV. Sony's 4K and High Dynamic Range technologies ensure that the colopur, contrast and brightness of images are drastically improved. Slim Backlight Drive By identifying high-contrast areas and dynamically adjusting the backlight, Sony's Slim Backlight Drive technology highlights blacks and makes other hues from the colour gamut more vibrant. Triluminos Display Thanks to this TV's Triluminos display, the subtler colours in the gamut won't get too saturated. So, images will look natural and vivid. X-tended Dynamic Range PRO A special backlighting algorithm, Sonny's X-tended Dynamic Range PRO adds more lucidity to brights while deepening blacks. This technology makes images more brilliant when coupled with an HDR signal. Android TV: A World of Possibilities You can connect a variety of Android-based smartphones and tablets to this TV and keep information synced between all of them. Now, you can play the games, use the apps and watch the movies that you do on your smartphone on this TV. 4K X-Reality PRO Sony's 4K X-Reality PRO technology analyses and matches parts of each scene independently to enhance colour, contrast, pictorial texture and edges. 4K Processor X1 This powerful processor analyses and enhances videos to near 4K resolution. So, you can enjoy movies from TV broadcasts, Blue-Ray discs, DVDs or 4K YouTube videos in stunning quality. A Master Piece of Design Thanks to its super-slim design and imposing size, this BRAVIA TV will add to the spectacularity of your living room. The wires are placed discreetly, so they won't mess with the aesthetic appeal of your hall. Google Play You can access a wide range of movies, games, TV shows, e-books and apps on this TV from Google's Play Store. The entertainment that you enjoy on your smartphone or tablet, you can experience on this TV's large screen. Google Cast Thanks to Google Cast, you can mirror that content that's on your Android/iOS-based smartphone or tablet on this TV's grand screen. Voice Search When you want to search for a certain movie, you don't need to waste time by typing  each letter out. Use the 'Voice Search' feature to search for specified content across a variety of services. Plus, if you use your voice and search for 'romantic comedies', you'll get results that relate to the pronouned words. Immerse Yourself in 3D Put on a pair of active shutter glasses to greatly improve the depth of flicks and to watch them in 3D. Motionflow XR Motionflow XR technology compares essential visual factors by the frame and inserts additional frames whenever there are lapses between scenes. The result is a crystal-clear, blur-free visual experience. Super-slim Flush Surface Display Thanks to the flush finish and lack of raised bezels, this TV's edges are barely noticeable when you're watching a video. Clean-rear Look This TV's cables are well-concealed behind its panel. They exit it from the centre of its stand, so even if you place this TV on a table, the wires won't jut out in a weird fashion. X-Protection PRO Since there are no ventilation holes behind this TV, the chances of dust entering it are slim. Anti-humidity coating ensures that high moisture levels in the air don't short circuit the circuit board. Content Bar You can bring up the Content Bar to browse through available channels or your downloaded movie collection while the video you're watching runs in the background. You can customize the Content Bar to show you the videos  that you watch regularly. IR Blaster Thanks to the Infra-red Blaster remote, you can easily control your TV and other devices, like your set-top box or cable box. Serial AbTak An exclusive catch-up TV app called Serial AbTak gives you access to various TV shows from regional and national channels. You can also set favourites, make personalized playlists or arrange shows by language, channel or episode. TV SideView App Thanks to the TV SideView app, you can seek out, record and talk about your favourite TV serials. Keep track of the lastest TV schedules and trending TV shows on your iOS/Android smartphone or tablet. Notify BRAVIA If you get a call, message or social-app update on your smartphone, you'll be notified on your TV screen. Just download the Notify BRAVIA app from Google Play on your smart device and keep it connect to the same network as your TV. ClearAudio+ Thanks to ClearAudio+ technology, this TV's audio is refined for a more immersive cinematic experience. Sound is more spaced out so music, dialogues and OSTs will be clearer. Cinematic S-Force Front Surround S-Force Front Surround technology emulates the way the brain processes sounds so the volume stays at ideal levels. It also optimizes the sound wave spectrum and time lag for rich, high-fidelity audio. Digital Sound Enhancement Engine Low-quality MP3 files and low-res videos feature heavily compressed audio, so there's a lot of loss when it comes to the sound quality. However, Sony's Digittal Sound Enhancement Engine restires lost frequency components (especially high frequencies) to make the audio more natural. Clear Phase Thanks to Sony's Clear Phase technology, frequencies are accurately sampled so irregularities in the peaks and troughs of sound waves are rectified for a clearer sound.","imageUrls":{"200x200":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/200/200/jgzfv680/television/r/s/y/sony-kd-55x9300d-original-imaf53krfacgvjhf.jpeg?q=90","400x400":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/400/400/jgzfv680/television/r/s/y/sony-kd-55x9300d-original-imaf53krfacgvjhf.jpeg?q=90","800x800":"https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/jgzfv680/television/r/s/y/sony-kd-55x9300d-original-imaf53krfacgvjhf.jpeg?q=90"},"productFamily":["TVSEGVJ4PRKYVRSY"],"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":264900,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSellingPrice":{"amount":264900,"currency":"INR"},"flipkartSpecialPrice":{"amount":144999,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"https://www.flipkart.com/sony-139cm-55-inch-ultra-hd-4k-led-smart-tv/p/itmegvj4wx7gn4gn?pid=TVSEGVJ4PRKYVRSY&affid=yuganshch","productBrand":"Sony","inStock":true,"codAvailable":false,"discountPercentage":45,"offers":["No Cost EMI on Bajaj Finserv Card","No Cost EMI on Credit Cards","Upto ₹15,000 off on Exchange","10% Instant Discount* on HSBC Cards","10% off* with Axis Bank Buzz Credit Card"],"categoryPath":"Electronics>Entertainment>TV & Video>TVs","attributes":{"size":"","color":"","storage":"","sizeUnit":"","displaySize":"55"}},"productShippingInfoV1":{"shippingCharges":{"amount":0,"currency":"INR"},"estimatedDeliveryTime":"Usually Delivered in 7 - 8 days.","sellerName":"Consulting Rooms Private Ltd","sellerAverageRating":4.2,"sellerNoOfRatings":222661,"sellerNoOfReviews":2745},"categorySpecificInfoV1":{"keySpecs":["Ultra HD (4K) 3840 x 2160 Pixels","30 W Speaker Output","100 Hz Refresh Rate","4 x HDMI | 3 x USB"],"detailedSpecs":["Ultra HD (4K) 3840 x 2160 Pixels","30 W Speaker Output","100 Hz Refresh Rate","4 x HDMI | 3 x USB"],"specificationList":[{"key":"General","values":[{"key":"In The Box","value":["1 TV Unit"]},{"key":"Model Name","value":["KD-55X9300D"]},{"key":"Display Size","value":["139 cm (55)"]},{"key":"Screen Type","value":["LED"]},{"key":"HD Technology & Resolution","value":["Ultra HD (4K), 3840 x 2160"]},{"key":"3D","value":["No"]},{"key":"Smart TV","value":["Yes"]},{"key":"Curve TV","value":["No"]},{"key":"Touchscreen","value":["No"]},{"key":"Motion Sensor","value":["No"]},{"key":"HDMI","value":["4"]},{"key":"USB","value":["3"]},{"key":"Built In Wi-Fi","value":["Yes"]},{"key":"Launch Year","value":["2016"]}]},{"key":"Internet Features","values":[{"key":"Built In Wi-Fi","value":["Yes"]},{"key":"3G Dongle Plug and Play","value":["No"]},{"key":"Ethernet (RJ45)","value":["1"]}]},{"key":"Connectivity Features","values":[{"key":"HDMI","value":["4 Side"]},{"key":"USB","value":["3 Side"]}]},{"key":"Video Features","values":[{"key":"LED Display Type","value":["Yes"]},{"key":"Refresh Rate","value":["100 Hz"]}]},{"key":"Audio Features","values":[{"key":"Number of Speakers","value":["4"]},{"key":"Speaker Output RMS","value":["30 W"]}]},{"key":"Power Features","values":[{"key":"Power Requirement","value":["AC 100 - 240 V, 50/60 Hz"]},{"key":"Power Consumption","value":["199 W, 0.5 W (Standby)"]}]},{"key":"Remote Control Features","values":[{"key":"Touch Remote","value":["No"]}]},{"key":"Dimensions","values":[{"key":"Width x Height x Depth (without stand)","value":["1239 mm x 36 mm"]}]},{"key":"Warranty","values":[{"key":"Warranty Summary","value":["1 Year Warranty"]},{"key":"Covered in Warranty","value":["Warranty of the Product is Limited to Manufacturing Defects Only"]},{"key":"Not Covered in Warranty","value":["Warranty Does Not Cover Any External Accessories (Such as Battery, Cable, Carrying Bag), Damage Caused to the Product Due to Improper Installation by Customer, Normal Wear and Tear to Magnetic Heads, Audio, Video, Laser Pick-ups and TV Picture Tubes, Panel, Damages Caused to the Product by Accident, Lightening, Ingress of Water, Fire, Dropping or Excessive Shock, Any Damage Caused Due to Tampering of the Product by an Unauthorized Agent, Liability for Loss of Data, Recorded Images or Business Opportunity Loss."]},{"key":"Warranty Service Type","value":["On-site"]}]},{"key":"Installation & Demo","values":[{"key":"Installation & Demo Details","value":["Please note that any unauthorized handling or self-installation of the product will lead to return & product warranty being void","We'll facilitate the installation and demo through authorized service engineer at your convenience.
